# MHS: The Game 2025

### MHS: The Game 2025 aims to parody the academic infatuation of a Melbourne High student.


Inspired by dollhouse horror games such as Little Nightmares and Ori and the Blind Forest, as well as TV and movies such as Stranger Things and Detention, the 2.5D story-based experience tells a metaphor for how overt fixation on academic success has engulfed the lives of MHS students.

A term-long discussion and ideas phase was held before the game began development in early Term 2 of 2024. The development of this game was facilitated by weekly Tuesday meetings, where members of Game Studio were able to discuss and help each other while working on the game in their own time.

The game is a spiritual successor to MHS: The Game 2022 and MHS: The Game 2023.
